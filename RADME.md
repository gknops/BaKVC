# BaKVC

*BaKVC* requires [*jQuery*](http://jquery.com/) version 1.7 or later!

*BaKVC* adds *Key Value Coding* support to JavaScript/jQuery, along with a powerful method to bind form elements to your data model. This enables you to better separate your data model from the UI code.

To use *BaKVC* simply include it into your HTML page by adding a header line similar to this one (replacing the path with what is appropriate for your site):

	<script type="text/javascript" src="BaKVC.js"></script>
